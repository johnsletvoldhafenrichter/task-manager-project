This is a calender project which is connected to my Mongo Atlas database. This is to showcase my capabilities in using flask, python, javascript and MongoDB

## Deployment
Here's a link to my deployed project: https://task-manager-john.herokuapp.com/

The .env-sample is made for storing the database information so feel free to put your own srv-key there in order to use this project.

This project was created in regards to my Code Institute studies.
